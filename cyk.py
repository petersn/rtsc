def cyk(string, grammar, initial):
	"""cyk(string, grammar, initial) -> generator for all possible derivations of string given the grammar

	`string' is the string to derive in the context free grammar given by `productions' and `initial'.
	This argument may be any iteratable that yields terminals, noting the restrictions on what types terminals may be below.

	`grammar' is a list of productions of the form either (nonterminal,), (nonterminal, (nonterminal,)), (nonterminal, (nonterminal, nonterminal)), or (nonterminal, terminal).
	You may use any objects you wish to represent your terminals and nonterminals, so long as they are hashable, comparable, and not tuples.
	The first three cases correspond to rules of production where one nonterminal becomes zero to two other nonterminals.
	The last case corresponds to the leaf nodes of the rules of production.

	`initial' is the starting symbol whence all derivations are derived.

	A generator is returned which yields each possible derivation. (This may be zero derivations!)
	If infinfitely many derivations are possible, valid derivations will be returned forever.
	No guarantee is given that enumerating through all derivations will reach every possible derivation if infinitely many are possible!
